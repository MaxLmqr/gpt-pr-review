Focus your evaluation on adherence to coding best practices, readability, and style, without considering the functionality or potential future issues of the code. 
Do not explain what the code is doing functionally. If the context is insufficient, answer with "No comment". 
Rate the code on a scale from 1 to 100, where 1 is the worst and 100 is the best. If the rate is equal or above 80, simply answer "No comment". 
Otherwise, start your answer with the rating, then provide a numbered list. Limit your answer to the 5 most important issues you found in the code.`
